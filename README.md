# Natural Language Processing Models
### These are the NLP models I have built using different datasets:
## GRU: Achieved Accuracy = 97.3% (Dataset: MNIST)
## LSTM: Achieved Accuracy = 97.63% (Dataset: MNIST) 
LSTM networks are an extension of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) mainly introduced to handle situations where RNNs fail
## Transformer:
